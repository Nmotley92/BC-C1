# Week 1 challenge


## Description

A small project done after my first week of coding bootcamp to simulate working on a real world ticket.  Focused on making html code semantic and also consolidating selectors in the CSS style sheet.  It helped me learn how to take code from a develope file and make it more semantic and efficient.

N/a

    
## Usage/Examples

A test site so new developers can learn semantic html.
